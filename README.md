# About This Project

Welcome to my test project repository! This is a practice project where I am learning the basics of GitHub, HTML, and web development. The goal of this project is to upload a simple website, understand version control, and get familiar with the GitHub platform.

## Project Purpose

The primary objectives of this project include:
- Practicing HTML structure by creating basic pages.
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub for version control.
- Gaining experience with Visual Studio Code for code editing and project management.

## Files in This Repository

- **index.html**: The home page for the site with navigation links.
- **about.html**: A simple webpage that contains a brief "About Me" section.
- **styles.css**: Shared stylesheet used by the pages.
- **README.md**: (This file) provides an overview of the project and outlines whatâ€™s included in the repository.

## Next Steps

Here are the next steps I'm planning to work on:
1. Improve the layout and styling of the pages.
2. Add more details to the README file as the project grows.
3. Experiment with Git commands to manage commits, branches, and merges.

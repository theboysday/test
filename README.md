# About This Project

Welcome to my test project repository! This is a practice project where I am learning the basics of GitHub, HTML, and web development. The goal of this project is to upload a simple webpage, understand version control, and get familiar with the GitHub platform.

## Project Purpose

The primary objectives of this project include:
- Practicing HTML structure by creating a basic `about.html` page.
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub for version control.
- Gaining experience with Visual Studio Code for code editing and project management.

## Files in This Repository

- **about.html**: A simple webpage that contains a brief "About Me" section, created as a practice exercise.
- **README.md**: (This file) provides an overview of the project and outlines whatâ€™s included in the repository.

## Next Steps

Here are the next steps I'm planning to work on:
1. Improve the layout and styling of the `about.html` page.
2. Add more details to the README file as the project grows.
3. Experiment with Git commands to manage commits, branches, and merges.
